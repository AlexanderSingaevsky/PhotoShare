## Description

Our program provides the user with the ability to upload, edit and delete images. There is a convenient tag system that allows you to narrow your search according to your interests. It is possible to comment on the image. There is also a rating system based on user ratings. In short, everything you need to save and share memories.

## Project Installation

To manage project dependencies, `pipenv` is used.

- Make sure you have `pipenv` installed
- Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/NightSpring1/InstaLike_PhotoSharing`
- To install the dependencies, use the `pipenv install` or `pipenv sync` command.

Detailed steps in your terminal a following:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/NightSpring1/InstaLike_PhotoSharing
$ cd InstaLike_PhotoSharing
$ pipenv install
$ python main.py
```

## Implementation

Once the application is running _locally_, you can browse to run it on your local host using the following links[^1]:

- To view detailed information on our project [http://localhost:8000/views/info](http://localhost:8000/views/info)
- To view detailed information on our project in `JSON` format [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000)
- To test the connection to the database and server time information [http://localhost:8000/api/healthchecker](http://localhost:8000/api/healthchecker)

For comfortable viewing of `JSON` respone in your browser we recommend to install the extension for Google Chrome
[JSON Viewer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-viewer/gbmdgpbipfallnflgajpaliibnhdgobh/related?hl=ru) or
[JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=ru) (according to your taste)

### API routes

The main task of the project was to implement a REST API, which plays a key role in ensuring effective interaction between interface developers (React, View, Angular) and our service.

All documentation on interacting with our API is available at the following links:

- To view swagger documentation [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
- To view redoc documentation [http://localhost:8000/redoc](http://localhost:8000/redoc)

## Information for Developers

Our project is equipped with Sphinx documentation, which you can find at [https://github.com/NightSpring1/InstaLike_PhotoSharingExchange/](https://github.com/NightSpring1/InstaLike_PhotoSharingExchange/). The documentation may be useful to other developers who
can use it to develop our project.
